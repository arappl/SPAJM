# SPAJM

The code is a sample of the simulation study featured in "Spatial Joint Models through Bayesian Structured Piecewise Additive Joint Modelling for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data".
It is exemplary for simulating three sets of data - with the spatial effect in the longitudinal (etal), the survival (etas) and the shared (etals) predictor - and estimating them with BayesX and bamlss.

## Steps
1. Install BayesX from https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/download/550527.html
2. Set path of BayesX installation in "Run_BayesX.R"
3. Execute code in "Run_BayesX.R"
4. Execute code in "Run_bamlss.R"
